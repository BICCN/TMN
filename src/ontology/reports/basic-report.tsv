<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/TMN_0000028>	"A RNA-seq assay for transferring RNA from tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing."	
<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/TMN_0000013>	"A fluorescence in situ hybridization assay where transcripts are labeled with fluorescent probes in sequential rounds of hybridization to read out the temporal barcode for each transcript. The temporal barcodes can then be decoded to uniquely identify the RNA transcripts present in the sample. RNA can be identified directly in a variety of samples from extracted RNA to tissues."

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/TMN_0000022>	"A single-cell RNA sequencing assay that involves the isolation of single nuclei and open chromatin tagmentation in the isolated nuclei using a transposase. The tagmented nuclei are then encapsulated in a droplet including both an oligo-dT-containing barcoded bead and a splint oligonucleotide, which links the tagmented gDNA fragments to the bead, enabling the bead to capture both mRNAs and open chromatin fragments. After mRNAs and gDNA fragments are released from the bead by heating, RT and PCR amplification are performed to generate a library of cDNA and open chromatin gDNA fragments."

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/TMN_0000000>	"A sequencing assay that analyzes mRNA transcripts from droplets of individual cells. The droplets are compartmentalized via a microfluidic device. After the cells are compartmentalized, cells in droplets are lysed and the released mRNA hybridizes to the oligo(dT) tract of the primer beads. Then the droplets are pooled and broken to release the beads which are then isolated and reverse-transcribed with template switching. The resulting cDNA strands are PCR-amplified and the sequencing adapters are added. The barcoded mRNA samples are then sequenced."@en

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/TMN_0000014>	"A single cell sequencing assay wherein the target cells are lysed, and the RNA is hybridized to an oligo(dT)-containing primer. The first strand of the cDNA is synthesized with the addition of a few untemplated C nucleotides. This poly(C) overhang is added exclusively to full-length transcripts. An oligonucleotide primer is hybridized to the poly(C) overhang and used to synthesize the second strand. Full-length cDNAs are PCR-amplified to obtain nanogram amounts of DNA. The PCR products are purified for sequencing."
