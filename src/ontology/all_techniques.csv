10x chromium ATAC-seq,10x chromium ATAC sequencing assay|10x chromium ATAC-seq assay,An ATAC-seq assay that involves use of the 10x sequencing technology assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq).
anterograde tracing assay,,An assay wherein axon projections are traced from their source (cell body or soma) to their point of termination (synapse).
composite in situ imaging,CISI,A fluorescence microscopy assay wherein fluorescence in situ hybridization is leveraged with multiplexed analysis that uses each channel to measure the composite (sum) abundances of multiple genes in each channel and decompresses and determines individual gene level.
cre-dependent anterograde tracing assay,,A anterograde tracing assay that uses a Cre recombinase-dependent as a tracer.
droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing assay,Dropseq,"A sequencing assay that analyzes mRNA transcripts from droplets of individual cells. The droplets are compartmentalized via a microfluidic device. After the cells are compartmentalized, cells in droplets are lysed and the released mRNA hybridizes to the oligo(dT) tract of the primer beads. Then the droplets are pooled and broken to release the beads which are then isolated and reverse-transcribed with template switching. The resulting cDNA strands are PCR-amplified and the sequencing adapters are added. The barcoded mRNA samples are then sequenced."

retrograde transsynaptic tracing assay,,A retrograde tracing assay that traces the neural connections from a synapse to a soma allowing the mapping of connections between neurons in a structure and a target in the brain.
sci-ATAC-seq3,3-level sci-ATAC-seq|3-level single-cell combinatorial indexing ATAC sequencing assay,An ATAC-seq assay that involves single-cell combinatorial indexing at three levels.
sci-RNA-seq3,3-level sci-RNA-seq|3-level single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing assay,A RNA sequencing assay that involves three levels of indexing.
sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization assay,seqFISH,A fluorescence in situ hybridization assay where transcripts are labeled with fluorescent probes in sequential rounds of hybridization to read out the temporal barcode for each transcript. The temporal barcodes can then be decoded to uniquely identify the RNA transcripts present in the sample. RNA can be identified directly in a variety of samples from extracted RNA to tissues.
serial two-photon tomography,STPT,A fluorescence microscopy that generates high-throughput flourescence imaging of mouse brains by integrating two-photon microscopy and tissue sectioning. Serial two-photon tomography generates high-resolution datasets.
single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing assay,SNARE-seq|SNARE-seq assay|SNARE-seq2|SNARE-seq2 assay,"A single-cell RNA sequencing assay that involves the isolation of single nuclei and open chromatin tagmentation in the isolated nuclei using a transposase. The tagmented nuclei are then encapsulated in a droplet including both an oligo-dT-containing barcoded bead and a splint oligonucleotide, which links the tagmented gDNA fragments to the bead, enabling the bead to capture both mRNAs and open chromatin fragments. After mRNAs and gDNA fragments are released from the bead by heating, RT and PCR amplification are performed to generate a library of cDNA and open chromatin gDNA fragments."
switching mechanism at the 5' end of RNA template sequencing assay,SMART seq|SMARTseq,"A single cell sequencing assay wherein the target cells are lysed, and the RNA is hybridized to an oligo(dT)-containing primer. The first strand of the cDNA is synthesized with the addition of a few untemplated C nucleotides. This poly(C) overhang is added exclusively to full-length transcripts. An oligonucleotide primer is hybridized to the poly(C) overhang and used to synthesize the second strand. Full-length cDNAs are PCR-amplified to obtain nanogram amounts of DNA. The PCR products are purified for sequencing."
