For new term requests, please provide the following information (if available):

## Editor preferred term label

Some (exactly one) unique, unambiguous label for the term in American English. This should not include acronyms or jargon. 

## Alternative terms

Common synonyms or translations, of which there may be many. These can include acronyms and jargon. If the alternative terms are not in American English, please specify the language of the alternative terms. 

## Textual definition (proposed)

This is the meaning of the term expressed in Aristotelian form, if possible (i.e., "An A is a B that C" where 'A' is the new term, 'B' is the parent term, and 'C' differentiates A from other children of B.). 

## Definition source for textual definition

Each definition should have a definition source. If you are the creator of the definition, then you are the source. If the definition comes from a website, then the annotation should contain the permanent URL. If it comes from a publication, then use its DOI or PubMed URL.

## Logical definition (if available)

If you are familiar with Web Ontology Language (OWL) and comfortable specifying a logical defintioin, then please provide it. Otherwise, simple provide the parent term in this field. 

## Example of usage

Example of usage annotations can clarify a term's meaning. These examples provide specific cases that show the term in use. These can be common cases that demonstrate prototypical usage, or more uncommon cases that delimit the scope of the term. This field is not required, but is helpful.
